# Tomography-Reconstruction

Right now make sure you understand the code, or perhaps try different approach, so far it's working, the generator works perfectly, while the reconstruction works good - but there are couple of problems.

Check out the list of to-dos, i'll try to keep most if not all of them within the project itself, rather than files


Perhaps try implementing all of the code by yourself, you get to learn a lot on the way ! 
If you have got any ideas or Q's hit me up !
